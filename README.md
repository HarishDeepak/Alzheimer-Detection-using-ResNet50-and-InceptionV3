# Alzheimer Detection using ResNet50 and InceptionV3

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting Alzheimer's disease using two powerful convolutional neural networks: ResNet50 and InceptionV3. These models are pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and are fine-tuned to classify MRI images for Alzheimer detection.

## Features
- Utilizes ResNet50 and InceptionV3 architectures for Alzheimer detection.
- Includes scripts for preprocessing MRI images and evaluating model performance.
- Implements transfer learning to adapt the pretrained models to the Alzheimer's MRI dataset.

## Performance
The project compares the performance of the two models, with InceptionV3 achieving the highest test accuracy of 91.43%.
